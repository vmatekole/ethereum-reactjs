You just ask it to render a component.\n\nAdditionally, React Mounter can work as a simple Layout Manager where you can use with [Flow Router](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router).\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nInstall with:\n\n```\nnpm i --save react-mounter react react-dom\n```\n\n> `react` and `react-dom` are peerDependencies of `react-mounter`. So, you need to install them into your app manually.\n\nThen let's mount a component.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport {mount} from 'react-mounter';\n\nconst WelcomeComponent = ({name}) => (<p>Hello, {name}</p>);\n\nmount(WelcomeComponent, {name: 'Arunoda'});\n```\n\n## Using as a Layout Manager\n\nYou can user `react-mounter` as a layout Manager for Flow Router. Here's how to do it.\n\nLet's say we've a layout called MainLayout.\n\n```js\nconst MainLayout = ({content}) => (\n    <div>\n      <header>\n        This is our header\n      </header>\n      <main>\n        {content}\n      </main>\n    </div>\n);\n```\n\nNow let's try render to our `WelcomeComponent` into the `MainLayout`.\n\n```js\nmount(MainLayout, {\n  content: <WelcomeComponent name=\"Arunoda\" />\n});\n```\n\nThat's it.\n\n### To use the React Context\n\nIn order to use the React context, you need to render the `content` component inside the layout. So we need to pass a function instead of the React element. Here's how to do it.\n\n```js\nconst MainLayout = ({content}) => (\n    <div>\n      <header>\n        This is our header\n      </header>\n      <main>\n        {content()}\n      </main>\n    </div>\n);\n```\n\n> See, now content is a function.\n\nThen, we can pass the Welcome component like this:\n\n```js\nmount(MainLayout, {\n  content: () => (<WelcomeComponent name=\"Arunoda\" />)\n});\n```\n\n## Configure Root DOM node\n\nBy default React Mounter render our components into a DOM node called `react-root`. But, you can configure if by like below:\n\n```js\nconst {mount, withOptions} from `react-mounter`;\nconst mount2 = withOptions({\n    rootId: 'the-root',\n    rootProps: {'className': 'some-class-name'}\n}, mount);\n\nmount2(WelcomeComponent, {name: 'Arunoda'});\n```\n\n## Server Side Rendering (SSR)\n\nSSR is supported when used with [FlowRouter SSR](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/tree/ssr). Checkout this [sample app](https://github.com/kadira-samples/meteor-data-and-react).\n",
